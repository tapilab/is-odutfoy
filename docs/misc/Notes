triple using average on last games!

look at model, see which features are important :
Some seem much much more important than others, some redundance, exactly same coeffs for some features.
To investigate.

get rid of some players?

Mistake when average goals %.

Include position and get rid of players without?
restart from scratch.

binary feature for position
create new features per position
