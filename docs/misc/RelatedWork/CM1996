This paper is an extent to COI1987 in some ways.

It solves the same problem using a third (and much more complicated method)
There are more mathematic theorem's and proof as well as additionnal notions such as concordance (whethers opinions tend to move in the same direction)

The paper relies on the use of multivariate copulas (which is basically an n-dimentionnal CDF).

The data used in the paper are just example fully detailed inside.

The main issue remains the same with the amount of preprocessing the data would have to go through.

As in COI1987, to use this method would require a clever way to go from raw text to IDD RV
