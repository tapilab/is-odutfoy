This paper solves how to aggreate information from different sources.
The idea is how a decision maker (DM) can decide what to do when faced with different (and most likely dependent) expert's opinion.
The paper is however simplified since the "experts" are assumed to observe IID random variables. 
They have access to info unavailable to the DM who himself has knowledge about the experts.

The main idea is to find overlapping opinions using Bayes' rule.
The first method uses a normal distribution.
Then a Bernouilli Model is used.


The data used are made from examples made by the auhor of the paper, each of them showing an interesting property of the model.
Using it on real data requires a considering amount of preprocessing.

While interesting, it will actually be quite tricky to use.
